Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the the event organizers or online moderators.  

Some learn.js spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

**Reporting  **
If you are being harassed by a member of learn.js, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the learn.js organizers at dclearnjs@gmail.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
This code of conduct applies to learn.js spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of learn.js outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by learn.js members, especially learn.js organizers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The organizers reserve the right to exclude people from learn.js based on their past behavior, including behavior outside learn.js spaces and behavior towards people who are not in learn.js.  

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.  

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of learn.js members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.  

**Consequences  **
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, learn.js organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all learn.js spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other learn.js members or the general public.
