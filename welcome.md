# Welcome to DC learn.js!  

##  A few places you can start
If this is your first meet up with us, and/or you are new to JavaScript, you have a few places you can start. If you want to dive right into JavaScript, you can use tutorials like [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript), or [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/), or read [Eloquent JavaScript](eloquentjavascript.net/), which will teach you JavaScript right in your browser. JavaScript is the language of the browser, it was made to add interactivity to static sites. It creates those annoying alert boxes, and it makes those cool auto-filling select boxes. It powers news tickers, and makes interactive charts. You can write JavaScript write in the console on your browser. If you want to get set up with everything you will need to be a developer, you will want to first familiarize yourself with your tools.  

## Tool you will need to know
### Terminal or PowerShell
The first tool you will need to know is Terminal (Mac or Linux) or PowerShell (Windows). The Terminal is how you tell the computer to do stuff without the graphical user interface (GUI). You type in commands like "cd" (change directory, or telling the computer which folder you want to open) and mkdir (make directory, or telling the computer you want to make a new folder). One of the big reasons you will want to know how to use the command line is so you can use git. There is a handy guide to get you started with the [command line here](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).  

### Git
Git is the next tool you will need to know. Git is a version control system that makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same project at once, while keeping the main, or "master branch" clean. Each person can checkout their own branch, make changes locally, then 'merge' it into the master branch. GitHub, a social coding website, is built ontop of Git. It provides a great graphical history of all the changes to your project, right down to the line. There is a great tutorial on getting started with [Git here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).  

### text editor
The next tool you will need is a text editor. This is where you write most of your code at. There are lots of good text editors out there. Most of them come with 'syntax highlighting' (having different colored text for different parts of the code), and many of them can integrate with your version control system. A popular text editor is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). It has an unlimited free trial, so you can use it for awhile to see if you like it before commiting to purchasing it.  

### JavaScript
Despite those previous three points, you can still learn JavaScript first, and your tools second. As you get into JavaScript, you will encounter frameworks and libraries. These are bits of code other people have written and made available to the community. You can use frameworks like node.js, which takes JavaScript out of the browser and lets you run it on the server side.  Or you can learn Angular, or JQuery, or Ember, or Backbone! 

## Feel free to ask for help
At the meetup, please feel free to ask for help, and to help others who ask for help. If someone looks like they are struggling, please politely say "It looks like you are having difficulty. Would you like assistace?" or "You look like you're working on something cool, can I watch? Or could you explain what you're doing?" and always make sure to ask someone before touching their computer or keyboard. Feel free to do the same on our [slack channel](http://dclearnjsinvites.herokuapp.com/), post screenshot of problems you are stuck on, or give advice to someone.  

## Always be respectful
Always be respectful, and remember to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/jdax/dclearnjs/blob/master/codeofconduct.markdown). Lastly, JavaScript is fun!
